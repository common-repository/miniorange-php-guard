What is PHP Obfuscation?

When you have a php project you want to distribute, as php is a script interpretor,
you distribute also all the sources of your software!

You may want, for any reason, that other people do not understand, modify, or adapt your software.

As your software must be understandable by the **php runtime**, but needs to be very difficult
to understand by human people, php obfuscation is a very good way to achieve this goal.
